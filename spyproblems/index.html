<h3>Limerick:</h3>
<p>Have you heard about the world’s greatest spy?<br>
A man with skills no one can deny,<br>
His name is Captain Calculus,<br>
Whether by car, by boat, or by bus<br>
No one can catch him or even try.<br>
<br><br>
It was 83.3 km from El-Lipsa’s borders,<br>
He escaped a smuggling ring’s headquarters in disorder.<br>
Driving a milk truck at 72 km/h with a 40 minute head.<br>
If he got caught he would be dead.<br>
His enemies chased at 168 km/h after settings things to order.<br>
<br><br>
Calculus escaped, from smugglers I reckon<br>
Seventy minutes later, his vanishing beckon<br>
The smuggling ring followed him<br>
But missed the border by just a limb<br>
Or 14/15 kilometers, and 20 seconds?<br>
